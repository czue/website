                        <h1>About the Sabbatical</h1>
                        <p>In late 2016 I found myself feeling de-energized in my CTO job and decided I needed a change.</p>
                        <p>The result is what I’m calling my <em>solopreneur sabbatical:</em>
                           a six month exploration into the world of solo-entrepreneurship as I attempt to
                           launch a product and earn money from it.</p>
                        <p>I’m <a href="{% link writing.html %}">writing regularly</a> about my progress on this site.
                           You can read more about about my journey and plans in my first update: "<a href="{% post_url writing/sabbatical/2017-03-27-the-solopreneur-sabbatical %}">The Solopreneur Sabbatical</a>".</p>
                        <p>Join me on the adventure!<p>

                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>My name's Cory. I'm an American software developer living in beautiful Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
                        <p>For the past 10 years I've served as CTO of <a href="http://www.dimagi.com/">Dimagi</a>, a social enterprise that specializes in mobile applications for underserved populations.
                           While there I led the 25-person technology team that builds <a href="https://www.commcarehq.org/">CommCare</a>, thought a lot about productivity, and wrote a lot of code.</p>
                        <p>In my personal life I enjoy exploring the mountains around Cape Town, pretending I know how to surf, pretending I am in a band, traveling the world, and taking lots of pictures with my Pixel.</p>
                        <p>I'm originally from the suburbs of Boston, grew up in a family of MIT nerds, and am recently married to a wonderful colleague of mine.</p>
