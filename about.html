                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>Hi, I'm Cory. I'm an American software developer living in beautiful Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
                        <p>For the past 10 years I've served as CTO of <a href="http://www.dimagi.com/">Dimagi</a>, a social enterprise that specializes in mobile applications for underserved populations. While there I led the 25-person team that builds <a href="https://www.commcarehq.org/">CommCare</a>, thought a lot about productivity, and wrote a lot of code.</p>
                        <p>In my personal life I enjoy exploring the mountains around Cape Town, pretending I know how to surf, pretending I am in a band, traveling the world, and taking lots of pictures with my Pixel.</p>
                        <p>I'm originally from the suburbs of Boston, grew up in a family of MIT nerds, and am recently married to a wonderful colleague of mine.</p>

                        <h1>About the Sabbatical</h1>
                        <p>Towards the end of 2016, as I approached my 10-year anniversary at Dimagi, I found myself in a rut.</p>
                        <p>I was still deeply invested but no longer feeling deeply excited; working long, stressful hours, but without the corresponding boost of energy and fulfillment that usually came with hard work. At the same time I felt like Iâ€™d been doing the same thing so long I was no longer learning. My work was demanding but not challenging. I understood how to be a good (or at least okay) CTO for Dimagi, but what else was I good at?</p>
                        <p>That was when I knew I needed a break.</p>
                        <p>I have two primary goals for the sabbatical:<p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><em>Be happier</em> - primarily achieved by working less, and leading a more balanced and diverse life</li>
                            <li><em>Chart a future professional path</em> - primarily achieved by trying new things and assessing the feasibility of entrepreneurship</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I'm also planning on regularly publishing my progress. Join me on the adventure!</p>
