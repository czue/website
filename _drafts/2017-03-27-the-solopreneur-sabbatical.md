excerpt: From CTO to unemployed overnight and what to do next

*What the hell was I thinking?*

It's 4:43pm on March 20th, 2017. I'm less than 1 day into my 6-month sabbatical and I'm feeling a bit lost.

Sabbatical is a great word. "Unpaid sabbatical." It sounds so impressive; so academic; so professional; so *le3gitimate*. It doesn't sound quite so impressive if you use some of the other words that mean the same thing. Vacation. *Unemployment*.

How did I end up sitting on my couch, unemployed, staring at a computer with nothing to do? And what do I do now?

## Backstory

Let's journey back in time a bit.

Towards the end of 2016, as I approached my 10-year anniversary as CTO of [Dimagi](http://dimagi.com/) I found myself feeling like I was in a rut.

I was still deeply invested in my work, but no longer feeling deeply excited. I was working long and stressful hours, but without the corresponding boost of energy and fulfillment that I was accustomed to coming alongside hard work. As the organization, the team, and the responsibilities grew around me, so too did the demands on my time - leaving me with very little time to proactively build things - something I have always cherished. Somewhere along the line I had gone from [maker to manager](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) and didn't know how to go back.

That was when I knew I needed a change. I wanted to experience the joy of building something again. The joy of discovery - of doing something totally new and different. The joy of controlling my own time, and my own direction. *My own life.*

Dimagi was kind enough to give me six months off - no questions asked - and the solopreneur sabbatical was born.

## A solopreneur sabbatical

At this point you might be wondering "what is a solopreneur sabbatical?". Let me first explain what a solopreneur is. A solopreneur is an entrepreneur who - unlike most entrepreneurs - is in it for the lifestyle instead of the money. Someone who wants to "go it alone" instead of building an empire. It's a word that's becoming [increasingly](#fixme) [common](#fixme) among freelancers and lifestyle enthusiasts around the world.

When I first came across the term I knew it was exactly what I was looking for. I don't want to join an incubator, raise a bunch of money, or sell my company to Google. I don't want to hire people, experience exponential growth, or be "disruptive". What I want to do is make something a few people love, work on my own terms, and earn enough money to live how I want.

At the end of the day, all I really want is to be happy. And my current best guess at what that would mean is working as much as I choose to, doing things I love, and leading a rich life outside of work.

## What are my plans so far?

I imagine my plans will be in constant flux, but here are a few things I've decided so far.

**I want to do this in public**. That's why I'm writing this. Whatever I do I want to document it as I go along. There's nothing quite like experiencing someone's journey in real time - celebrating their successes and learning from their failures together. I also think this will create some worthwhile accountability to keep me off the couch.

**I want to build things**. I love making things. There's no feeling like the rush of productivity when you achieve "flow" and in the blink of an eye 6 hours have gone by, or the joy of watching someone use a product you've built and seeing them "get it". I want more joy of creation in my life.

**I want to launch something that earns money**. Building things is fun but doesn't pay your bills. Ultimately to achieve a lifestyle I want I'm going to need to figure out how to make some money. I have to guess that for every person who thinks about making a product, 80% of them never do, and of the ones that do I bet another 80% never earn a dollar off them.

*My guess at what the community of product-makers looks like*


In the short term, I expect my next few weeks to be filled with refining my systems for how to stay on task, exploring possible product ideas, and starting to get some feasibility assessments out. And, like I said, I plan to write about the whole process here.

## What's my call to action?

If you've gotten this far and aren't my wife or my father, wow! Thanks for reading - I'm truly grateful. For now, I'd just love your feedback - if you have any input or advice I'd love to hear from you in the comments or you can [contact me directly]({% link contact.html %}).

One other thing I thought I'd try is polling you, my audience, to determine what I write about next. I have three topics I'm considering:

* **My day-to-day approach to the sabbatical** - how I'm struggling with, and overcoming the pitfalls of laziness and lack of direction using tools and tricks learned in my 10 CTO years

* **How I built this website** - using all new technologies to me. The website is made with Jekyll, a static site generator, hosted on Amazon S3, and uses the Bulma CSS framework (as well as some peripheral 3rd party services like Mailchimp and Disqus).

* **A discussion of some of the product ideas I'm thinking of pursuing** - and my current best thinking of how I can evaluate them.

If you're reading this, please vote in this poll! It is totally anonymous and will take you 3 seconds. I have no idea what aspects of this process others are interested in and this will be my first data point.

Finally, if you are interested in following along with my journey I'd love it if you signed up to receive email updates from me below. I promise never to mail you more than once a week, and you can unsubscribe whenever you want.

That's all for now - thanks for reading!

Cory
