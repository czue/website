                        For the past 10 years I've served as Chief Technology Officer of <a href="http://www.dimagi.com/">Dimagi</a>, a social
                        enterprise that specializes in mobile applications for underserved populations.
                        While there I led the 25-person team that builds <a href="https://www.commcarehq.org/">CommCare</a>.

                        I'm currently taking a sabbatical from my day job to explore the world of possibilities around me.
